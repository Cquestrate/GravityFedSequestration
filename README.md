Lime is heaver than salt water, and CO2 concentrations in the ocean increases with depth.
Lowering lime derived from heat-treating limestone into ocean depths is an opportunity to
generate energy while improving the efficiency of CO2 absorption.

The energy generated at sea could perhaps be stored in batteries aboard ship. Generating
hydrogen through electrolysis (though inefficient) is another possibility.

This repo will contain simulation modeling code for assessing how economical the idea is,
after costs of shipping.
