Lime is 12% denser than salt water, and [CO2 concentrations in the ocean increase with depth](http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~jdirnber/BioOceanography/Lectures/LecPhysicalOcean/LecPhysicalOcean.html).
Using cables to lower lime that's been derived from heat-treating limestone is an opportunity to
generate energy while improving the efficiency of CO2 absorption. The energy per kg required
to ship lime out to points where the oceans are deep should be relatively small compared to
the potential energy (even after factoring out buoyancy) of lime between the surface and
the depths. If lime is coated on objects to yield a net density for the objects that's
between that of seawater > 3 deep and liquid CO2 at those ocean pressures, the objects could
form a layer on top of a reservoir of sequestered liquid CO2, limiting the diffusion of the
reservoir's CO2 not only as a barrier but by absorption.

The energy generated at sea could perhaps be stored in batteries aboard ship. Generating
hydrogen through electrolysis (though inefficient) is another possibility.

This repo will contain simulation modeling code for assessing how economical the idea is,
after costs of shipping.
